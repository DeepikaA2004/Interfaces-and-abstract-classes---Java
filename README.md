# Interfaces-and-abstract-classes---Java
Develop a Java program to implement inheritance using Interfaces and Abstract classes use packages.

# PROCEDURE
An interface with an abstract method to calculate the area is defined. <br>
 A class Rectangle is defined to implement the interface.  <br>
 The class has a concrete definition of the abstract method.  <br>
 Any instance of the class can be used to invoke the method. <br>
 Another abstract class with an abstract method draw is created.  <br>
 A concrete implementation is provided in the sub-class Circle.  <br>
 An instance of the class circle can invoke the draw method. <br>
